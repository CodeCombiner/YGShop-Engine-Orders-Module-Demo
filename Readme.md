## About this source

 This is a source demo to show my skills with part of my own real project which is udner development. The source code was made in fall 2017. The app is based on Play Framework, uses Silhouette authentication libray, Slick with PostgreSQL, Flyweight migrations admin and client routes and Docker plugin.
 
 The settings and dev ops demos are absent in this source because they are out of scope of Scala skills demo.
